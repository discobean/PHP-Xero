Description:
This is a class I made with help from David Pitman's original PHP Class located here: https://github.com/thinktree/PHP-Xero
It interacts with the xero.com private application API

I originally built this so that I can talk to the API in an OO way.

It is kind of similar to ActiveRecord, but for the Xero API.

Right now only handles a few method calls, but its all I needed at the time:
 * Create/Find a Contact
 * Find an Account
 * Create a new Invoice
 * Download Invoice as PDF
